## Introduction
This was the final major project submission for the Msc Music and Sound Technology (Audio Programming) at the University of Hertfordshire. The project revolved around creating a delay plugin that attenuated its feedback loop in response to the dry signal. This would create an inverse relationship between the wet and dry signal where as the dry signal was louder the wet signal would be quieter and vice versa.
